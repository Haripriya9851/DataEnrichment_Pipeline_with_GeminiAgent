# Data Enrichment Pipeline with Gemini Agent

## Project Context
This project aims to develop a robust data enrichment pipeline leveraging Python and cloud technologies. The solution is designed to automate the process of enriching data with additional context and deploying the pipeline in a scalable cloud environment.

## Objectives

### Task 1: Build a Python-Based Data Pipeline
- Develop a data pipeline using Python to automate data enrichment processes.
- Integrate various data sources and apply enrichment logic.
- Ensure the pipeline is modular, maintainable, and scalable.

### Task 2: Design a Cloud Deployment Architecture
- Architect a cloud-based solution for deploying the data pipeline.
- Ensure scalability, reliability, and security in the deployment.
- Utilize best practices for cloud infrastructure and automation.

- **Task 1 - Data Pipeline/**: Contains the Python scripts and requirements for building and running the data enrichment pipeline. As I did not have "API" subscription I faced toomanyrequests() error. 
- **Task-2 - Pipeline Architecture/**: Contains documentation and architecture diagrams for the cloud deployment solution.
