# Task 2 - Pipeline Architecture

## Overview
This task focuses on designing a scalable and reliable cloud deployment architecture for the data enrichment pipeline developed in Task 1.

## Objectives
- Architect a cloud-based solution for deploying the data pipeline.
- Ensure scalability, reliability, and security in the deployment.
- Utilize best practices for cloud infrastructure and automation.

## Included Files
- `GCP_Architecture.pdf`: This document provides a detailed diagram and explanation of the proposed Google Cloud Platform (GCP) architecture for deploying the data enrichment pipeline.

## Key Considerations
- The architecture is designed to support automated data processing and enrichment at scale.
- Emphasis is placed on modularity, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness.
- Security and compliance best practices are incorporated into the design.

## Next Steps
- Review the `GCP_Architecture.pdf` for a visual representation and detailed explanation of the deployment approach.
- Adapt the architecture as needed based on specific project requirements or cloud provider preferences.
